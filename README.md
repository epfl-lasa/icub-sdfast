# Description 
The model of icub as a floating base robot (sdfast_model.sd) should be run seperately in sdfast. Then, the output files of sdfast including c codes should be provided in icub-sdfast/src.
Here, an interface is provided to extract required information (like mass matrix) from the SDFAST output codes.

Note:
sdfast_model.sd is the description file which is used as the input for SDFAST to generate the symbolic dynamic.
sdfast_model_d.c, sdfast_model_s.c, sdfast_model_i are the outputs of SDFAST which are needed here to compute mass matrix, gravitational and .. forces.

The folder named "codes" includes a library that provides an interface with SDFAST outputs. 
"pre-computation" doesn't have any function here. it includes some matlab codes and an excel file which are used for preparing the "sdfast_model.sd".

# Test the functionality
navigate to icub-sdfast folder, then:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make 
	./test

# Code Implementation
In icub-sdfast/codes/src/Model.cpp, "get_massmat" and "get_frcmat" return the mass matrix and gravitational, corriolis and ... forces respectively.
The Model class(model.cpp and model.hpp) interfaces with the SDFAST library to use its functions.

Before using this interface, following steps should be done:

1 - The number of states (AIR_N_Q) and number of state derivatives (AIR_N_U), also the number of bodies and joints should be defined in icub-sdfast/sdfast/include/Description.hpp

2-  Description of state vector and its derivative, as well as body and joint indices can be defined in Description.hpp. This step is optional.

3-  Minimum and maximum feasible joint angles should be specified in Model.cpp (Model::init).
